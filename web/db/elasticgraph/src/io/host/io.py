# Network IO Services

#  Manages connections with network relay, which is an proper node on the network.
# Proper node refers to nodes running bidirectionally secure and mutually trusted
# channels, paying for distributed execution across a network, for a small fee.
# Blockchain execution markets exist on a distributed cluster of nodes.
# Bidirectional trusted execution works as follows:
# Client makes a request to a frontend, or through the web API
#   That frontend sends an HTTP GET request to a server running on a remote host, which triggers a VM node to be born in thawaiting a response, creating a timeout counter
#   that, upon reaching 0, causes the process to respawn()
#
#
# The idea
# is to use Bitcoin and develop a simple smart contract layer on top of
# Activity of a network can be measured over the time period t_0 to t_N:
#
#   U - peers.count (if peers.count > 0 and peersMgr.status == "ON")
#   V - peers.receive (checks port variable's value, which loads from config.file into memory)
#
#
#   PC2 - Peer Count/Control
#
